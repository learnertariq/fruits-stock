            You will surprise to know about my aim why I want to be a Web
            Developer. Specially my goal not is not specific to web. I am quite
            tech savvy person. I want to lead a simple life and I want to help
            others. Time and and Leisure are the two most precious gift given by
            Allah. I believe, Being a web developer I can help the clients as
            well as the poor people. So, I try to work hard and teach my mind
            not to be dissatisfied at any blessing given by Allah. And I try to
            utilize time and being patient I believe to change the world so that
            We can have the satisfaction of our Creator Allah.
